# landing-page
This is a project that is part of the odin-project curriculum.  My goal is to make a "landing page" in a somewhat professional style using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and specifically flexbox.

This is also an opportunity to practice using github, from start to finish on a project and understand the workflow of making comits when buidling.
